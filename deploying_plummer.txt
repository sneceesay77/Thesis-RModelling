First put the necessary codes in to a R script, this should have an end point that the API can be accessed from. See deploy_plumer.R file. 

To run the plummer then use Rscript command, The plummer runner code is simple, see plumer_deamon.R file. 

Rscript plumer_deamon.R

You can use nohup to have this run as a process. 

 
User curl or POSTMAN to send request to the REST api
curl -X POST -d '{"DataSizeGB":18, "NumEx":16, "ExCore":4, "ExMem":8, "LevelPar":16, "App":"SVM"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 127.0.0.1:6767/predict


If I want deploy this on the Ubuntu Server and Proxy through the hosts servers at st-andrews then I have to edit the following file. 

/host/sc306/nginx.d/default/proxy.conf

and add the following contents. 

location /dfwc/ {
 proxy_pass http://138.251.16.15:6767/predict;
}

so I can now access the REST API using. 

curl -X POST -d '{"DataSizeGB":20, "NumEx":16, "ExCore":4, "ExMem":8, "LevelPar":16, "App":"KMEANS"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  https://sc306.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/dfwc/
