Steps to take

1. You must get an offer code: Basically, an offer code identifies the service one is interested in. 

2. After getting an offer code, you can substitute the offer code in the url below. 

  https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/{offer_code}/current/index.{format}

So for EC2 pricing

3. https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/AmazonEC2/current/index.json --> to get the json file

4. https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/AmazonEC2/current/index.csv --> to get csv file

5. In my work, I use csv file and import that MongoDB for querying.

The size of the file is about 1.2 GB. Also the file gets updated regularly.
